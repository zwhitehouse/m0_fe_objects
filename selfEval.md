# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

----It felt good to be able to take the challenge, try my best, make mistakes, fix those mistakes, and use resources to help complete the challenge successfully. I feel like it showed that I am learning as I could never have done any of this even a month ago.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

My workflow is going alright, I do tend to get sucked into the work and attempt to complete problems without braking for hours which is taking a huge toll on my mental health as well as my ability to stay consistent and productive. I hope to change this as time goes on.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

Honestly so many different things that I learned and would like to remember as I go into Mod 1. I know I won't remember everything, which is why it is important to know how to use google and other online resources to help when needed. If I had to choose a task to remember going into Mod 1 it would be that you can add new items to an already created object using the objectname.itemname = value. This seems like it could be very useful in many situations.
